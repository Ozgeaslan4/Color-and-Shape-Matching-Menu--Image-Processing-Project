This project involves designing an interactive menu system for a restaurant where customers select dishes by choosing colored and shaped objects. Each color corresponds to one of four food groups (starters, snacks, main courses, and desserts), and there are three shape options for each color, representing different dishes within each group. The system uses object-oriented programming (OOP) to handle the structure of colors, shapes, and corresponding dishes with prices. Additionally, the project incorporates image processing using OpenCV to recognize the customer's choices from an image and confirm their order. The final step calculates the total price of the order.
